 * These are good-faith drafts written from what this website and this
 * repository actually do, not legal advice, and nobody with a practising
 * certificate has reviewed them. They were written against a specific
 * technical audit of the site:
 *   - no cookies are set, by this site or by anyone else
 *   - no third-party scripts, fonts, embeds, pixels or tag managers load
 *   - the only browser storage is one strictly necessary sessionStorage
 *     key that stops a form being submitted twice
 *   - analytics events go to an in-memory array and are sent nowhere
 *     unless VITE_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT is configured
 * If any of those four things changes, the cookie page and the privacy
 * page stop being true and must be updated in the same commit.
 *
 * Nothing here may state a contract term the founders have not agreed.
 * The refund page says what they confirmed: no cash refunds, and a
 * meeting that does not meet the written criteria is replaced.
