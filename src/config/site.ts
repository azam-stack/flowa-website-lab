/**
 * Site-wide configuration for Frank by Flowa. Anything that differs
 * between environments is read from Vite env variables here, in one
 * place, and nowhere else.
 *
 * - VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT: the POST endpoint for contact and quote
 *   submissions (the backend/ Cloudflare Worker, once deployed). Unset:
 *   submissions go to FormSubmit, which emails them to ahmed@flowa.dk.
 * - VITE_BOOKING_URL: the calendar every "Book a call" button opens.
 *   Defaults to the Cal.com intro call, with Anton added as a guest.
 * - VITE_CLIENT_DASHBOARD_URL: the "Client dashboard" nav link. Unset:
 *   the link is not rendered at all.
 * - VITE_SITE_URL: the canonical origin of this draft. Defaults to the
 *   GitHub Pages preview.
 * - VITE_DRAFT: "false" removes the noindex meta. Default: draft on.
